# FOCAL
3D FDTD code for propagation of electromagnetic waves in cold magnetized plasma.

Note that this code is still evolving. It has successfully passed a series of
basic benchmarks (propagation in vacuum, comparison with Gaussian beam
evolution, power calculation tests, comparison against EMIT-3D).
